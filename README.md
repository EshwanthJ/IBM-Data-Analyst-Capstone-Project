### Introduction
To be competitive in the global IT sector, itâ€™s essential to keep up with the ever-changing technologies. This project utilizes data analytics to highlight current and projected trends in the demand for skills related to programming languages, databases, and other technologies. It also examines the demographics of professionals in the technology sector.

### Data Collection
Data for this project was gathered from:
- Stack Overflow Survey
- IBM Site

### Data Processing
1. **Data Collection**: Aggregated data from multiple sources.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified patterns, trends, and key insights.
4. **Visualization**: Created dashboards to visualize data trends and findings.

### Key Findings
- **Programming Languages**: JavaScript is currently the most popular programming language and is anticipated to remain dominant in the future.
- **Database Usage**: MySQL has the highest usage currently, but PostgreSQL is projected to see increased demand.
- **Demographics**: The majority of survey respondents are males, predominantly from the USA, with an average age of 28 years.
